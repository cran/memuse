This package is an over-engineered solution to a mostly non-existent problem,
as a sort of love letter to other needlessly complex programs like the 
"Enterprise Fizzbuzz" https://github.com/Mikkeren/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition .

The package gives the user the size (memory usage) of an in-core, dense 
matrix.  The output is an S4 class object that can be manipulated to be 
presented in different ways (different units, short/long versions of those 
units, etc.).  For more information, see the package vignette and the manual.

For installation instructions, see the package vignette, located in the 
package source tree:  inst/doc/memuse-guide.pdf
